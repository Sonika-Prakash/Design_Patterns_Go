## Abstract Factory Design Pattern

**Abstract Factory** is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Problem
You are creating a **furniture shop simulator**. Your code consists of classes that represent:
- A family of related products, say: `Chair` + `Sofa` + `CoffeeTable`.
- Several variants of this family. For example, products `Chair` + `Sofa` + `CoffeeTable` are available in these variants: `Modern`, `Victorian`, `ArtDeco`.

So, you need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family. Also, you donâ€™t want to change existing code when adding new products or families of products to the program.


### Solution
1. Declare **abstract product interfaces** for all product types. Then make all **concrete product classes** implement these interfaces.
2. Declare the **abstract factory interface** with a set of creation methods for all abstract products.
3. Implement a set of **concrete factory classes**, one for each product variant.
4. Create **factory initialization** code. It should instantiate one of the concrete factory classes, depending on the application configuration or the current environment.
5. Use this **factory object** for the required operations.
